TA Head
of CS273 Digital System Design, POSTECH
Instructor: Prof. Young-Joo Suh
​
I operated a laboratory course of CSED273 Digital System Design and Experiment, in 2012 and 2013. I also managed all the instruments in the Digital System Experiment Room of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, POSTECH. In 2013 Spring, I prepared a new curriculum for experimental courses and created the course manual for the next batch of TAs.
I received a high TA evaluation score (4.8/5) and the best TA in the department award (2013 Spring).
