When you first access the web, the UI looks like Figure 5. <br/>Using the toggle button (3) at the bottom right, you can choose between the BLOOM and GPT LLM models.
<br/>Users can enter their questions in the input box (1) at the bottom and click the send button (2). <br/>The input box is then reset, and the entered question is displayed in a pink speech bubble (4). <br/>The selected LLM model and the user's query are sent to the backend, and the professor's response and image are received and displayed on the UI. The professor's response appears in a blue speech bubble (5), and the professor's image (6) is shown in the center of the screen, creating an experience as if the user is having a direct conversation with the professor.
